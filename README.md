v8dotnet
========


The **Repository** contains the following branches:
- **Master** (stable releases for windows)
- **development** (bleeding edge development changes)
- **development-mono** (bleeding edge development changes for mono)

**Summary:** A fairly non-abstracted wrapper for Google's V8 JavaScript engine.

What does that mean? Well, most other existing wrappers abstract most of the Google V8 engine's abilities away from you.  That's fine for simple tasks, but wouldn't you rather have full control over the power of the V8 engine from managed code?

I've carefully crafted a C++ proxy wrapper to help marshal fast communication between the V8 engine and the managed side.  One of the biggest challenges (which actually turned out to be simple in the end) was storing a field pointer in V8 objects to reference managed objects on call-backs (using reverse P/Invoke).  A special custom C# class was created to manage objects in an indexed array in an O(1) design that is extremely fast in locating managed objects representing V8 ones.

Interesting note: I was carefully considering future portability to the Mono framework as well for this project, so great care was made to make the transition as seamless/painless as possible. ;)

**License Clarification**

The license is LGPL.  In a nutshell, this means that you can link to the libraries from your own proprietary code, but if you modify the source files for anything in this project, the modified source and executables from it must also be made freely available as well (and you must clearly state you modified the code).

**Coming in Next Release (updated on August 7, 2013):**

  * Attempting to make it easier to deal with accessing nested properties/objects.
  * Looking into creating a system to allow easy binding (exposing) of C#/.NET objects to the JavaScript environment.
  * Created a new function '{V8Engine}.LoadScript(string scriptFile)' to make it easier to load JS files. :)
  * Integrating V8.NET into the client/server solution "DreamSpaceJS/Studio" (my answer to Microsoft abandoning Silverlight).  This will also help refine the V8.NET system in the process.  Scirra (Construct 2) has donated a license to help the project.
  * Added methods to make it easier to bind existing .NET object instances and types to the V8 JS environment.
  * **Possible Breaking changes:  Handles now have full access to the native objects without having to create a V8NativeObject instance.  In fact, V8NativeObject now wraps a Handle and redirects dynamic requests to it, and both Handle and InternalHandle implement the same methods for working on the native JavaScript objects.  This was done to allow dynamic property access on the handles without having to create another object to do it.  This change slightly affects the members and functionality of the V8NativeObject - but mostly behind the scenes.  This is still a WIP, so more things may break, but the end goal is to allow accessing objects easily using a chain of property names, such as 'a.b.c.d...'.**
  * V8NativeObject will now have a generic object (V8NativeObject<T>) version to allow injecting your own objects into it instead.  I want to get rid of the internal "_ObjectInfo' objects that hold member data that really should be in the object itself.  This will mainly affect only those who need to implement the interface (IV8NativeObject) instead of inheriting from V8NativeObject.  Under the new system, when initialized, you just cache a pointer to the 'V8NativeObject' instance wrapping your object.

**Completed Updates**

Added support for .NET 3.5.  I used some fancy build configurations to compile both in the same solution. ;) The only difference, as it pertains to this project, is that .NET 3.5 and under does not support "DynamicObject" (nor the dynamic type), and default parameters are not supported.

Looks like some people have issues with the DLLs loading.  I've made this better and have a more descriptive error to help correct the issues. :)

I spent a lot of time on the performance of the system and have been able to increased it quiet a bit. I have some simple garbage collection and performance testing scripts now that can be run from the console.

I'll also be looking into the WebRTC SDK in the near future as well to help support networkable servers that are compatible to the supported browsers (currently Chrome and Firefox).
